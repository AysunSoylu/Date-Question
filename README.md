# Date Question Application

This is a fun and interactive web application that asks a playful question:  
**"Do you wanna go out with me?"**

The application has two buttons:
- **Yes**: Leads to a success page with a happy animation.
- **No**: This button cannot be clicked as it moves away when hovered over, creating a humorous experience.

---

## Features
- **Interactive Buttons:**
  - The "Yes" button redirects to a page with a "Yeeeyyy!!" animation.
  - The "No" button moves randomly around the screen when hovered over, preventing the user from clicking it.
- **Playful Design:** The application features a cute design with pastel colors and an animated character.
- **Responsive UI:** Optimized for different screen sizes.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the application.
- **CSS:** For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For button interactions and logic.

---

## How It Works
1. When the user tries to click the "No" button, it moves to a random position on the screen using JavaScript.
2. Clicking the "Yes" button redirects to a second page (`yes.html`) with a celebratory message and animation.
3. The application uses simple yet effective JavaScript logic to create an engaging experience.
